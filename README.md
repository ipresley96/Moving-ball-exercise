# Moving-ball-exercise

Title: Moving Ball

This is an exercise I complete for MITs xPro Coding Certificate program. It served the purposes of allowing me to practice edge detection within the browser window. 

In the project my goal was to have multiple circle moving at the same time with one ball moving in a diagional movement acting as the signal to have the circles that move up and down move. 

Support: I use the course videos, youtube and stackoverflow to aid in this project.

Roadmap: In the future I planned to have the colors of the balls change when they hit the edge of the space the live in. 

Education purposes only.
